First python web scraper with the help of Kev5 :) 

Top athletes from around the world gather once a year for the KONA IRONMAN World Championship hosted in Kona, Hawaii. An Ironman triathalon consists of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.22-mile (42.20 km) run in that order. 

As a hobby data science project, Keval Khara and I extrapolated on the finish-time data from the official Ironman website www.ironman.com. Results below.
